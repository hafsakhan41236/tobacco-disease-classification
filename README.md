# Automated Detection and Multi-Class Classification of Tobacco Leaf Diseases Using CNN

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning–based system for detecting and classifying tobacco leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning (MobileNet/EfficientNet).  
The project includes dataset preparation, preprocessing, training pipelines, evaluation metrics, Grad-CAM visualizations, and an optional Streamlit web application for real-time prediction.
